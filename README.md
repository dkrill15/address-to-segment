# Address to Segment Mapping

## Notes
`./property_data/mod_Attom.csv` is too large to upload to GitHub. It must be manually added to a local copy. 
`/visualize.py` produces a map of property values and streets.
`/find_nearest.py` contains the code that matches each address to a street segments
The two folders contain files that process their respective datasets and enter them into a database
